Legend:
- GC: Galactic Center (0,0,0)
- Sol: Our solar system
- Thick lines (\): Galactic Bar major axis
- Quadrants (Q1-Q4): Defined by bar orientation

## Sol's Position Details
- Distance from GC: 8,300 parsecs
- Angle from bar: 288.9째 (measured clockwise from bar's major axis)
- Q4 position: 18.9째 from Q3/Q4 boundary (270째)
- Height above plane: 20 parsecs (not shown in top-down view)

## Scale Reference
