# Galactic Sector System

## Overview
The galaxy is divided into eight major sectors based on quadrants and position relative to the galactic plane. This system provides a more intuitive way to navigate the galaxy using the galactic center and galactic plane as primary reference points.

## Major Divisions

### Vertical Division (Z-Axis)
- **Alpha (A)**: Above galactic plane (Z > 0)
- **Beta (B)**: Below galactic plane (Z < 0)
- **Galactic Plane**: Z = 0 (±0.5 ly tolerance)

### Quadrant Division
- **Quadrant I (Q1)**: 0° to 90° (between galactic center and 90° counterclockwise)
- **Quadrant II (Q2)**: 90° to 180°
- **Quadrant III (Q3)**: 180° to 270°
- **Quadrant IV (Q4)**: 270° to 360°

## Sector Naming Convention

### Format
`[Quadrant]-[Alpha/Beta]-[Distance]-[Height]`

### Components
1. **Quadrant**: Q1, Q2, Q3, or Q4
2. **Vertical Position**: A (Alpha) or B (Beta)
3. **Distance**: Distance from Sol in light-years
4. **Height**: Distance above or below galactic plane in light-years

### Example
`Q1-A-150-25` represents:
- Quadrant 1 (0° to 90°)
- Alpha (above galactic plane)
- 150 light-years from Sol
- 25 light-years above galactic plane

## Major Sectors

   - Direction: Away from galactic center, above plane
   - Notable features: [To be filled]

6. **Q3-B**: Quadrant 3, Below plane
   - Direction: Away from galactic center, below plane
   - Notable features: [To be filled]

7. **Q4-A**: Quadrant 4, Above plane
   - Direction: 270° to 360°, above plane
   - Notable features: [To be filled]

8. **Q4-B**: Quadrant 4, Below plane
   - Direction: 270° to 360°, below plane
   - Notable features: [To be filled]

## Navigation Guidelines

### Primary Reference Points
1. **Sol**: Origin point (0,0,0)
2. **Galactic Center**: 0° reference for quadrant division
3. **Galactic Plane**: Z=0 reference for Alpha/Beta division

### Distance Measurement
- All distances are measured in light-years
- Primary distance is measured from Sol
- Height is measured as absolute distance from galactic plane

### Boundary Cases
- Stars within 0.5 ly of galactic plane may be referenced with either Alpha or Beta designation
- Stars exactly on quadrant boundaries use the lower quadrant number

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Relationship to 3D-MGRS
The Galactic Sector System complements the more precise 3D-MGRS by providing:
- Larger scale navigation reference
- More intuitive galactic positioning
- Easier verbal communication of general locations

### Use Cases
1. **Strategic Planning**: Division of space for administrative or military purposes
2. **Navigation**: Quick reference for general direction and position
3. **Communication**: Easy verbal description of locations
4. **Territory Definition**: Clear boundaries for political or administrative regions

## Future Enhancements

1. **Sub-sector Division**: Further division of major sectors for more precise reference
2. **Traffic Zones**: Definition of high-traffic corridors between sectors
3. **Strategic Points**: Identification of key navigational references within each sector
4. **Boundary Protocols**: Detailed protocols for handling edge cases and boundary regions
