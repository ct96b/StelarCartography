# Stelar Cartography Project - Programming Planner

## Background and Motivation
This project aims to map approximately 12,000 real star systems to fictional systems from the FASA Star Trek universe to create a scientifically grounded 3D star map for a sci-fi RPG setting. Previous attempts using spreadsheets ran into memory/performance limitations, requiring a programmatic approach.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Data Processing Challenges
- **Scale**: Processing 12,000+ stars efficiently
- **Coordinate Conversion**: Converting astronomical coordinates (RA, Dec, Distance) to 3D Cartesian
- **Spatial Queries**: Finding nearest neighbors and performing spatial analysis

### Mapping Challenges
- **Known Systems**: Some Star Trek systems have canonical real-world counterparts
- **Fictional Systems**: Most systems are fictional and need plausible assignments
- **Political Boundaries**: Need to maintain faction territories in 3D space

### Visualization Challenges
- **3D Rendering**: Displaying thousands of stars efficiently
- **Interactive Exploration**: Allowing users to navigate the 3D map
- **Information Display**: Showing relevant star data on selection

## Implementation Details

### Data Model 
```python
# Star system class outline
class StarSystem:
    # Basic attributes
    id: str                 # Unique identifier
    name: str               # Common name
    coordinates: dict       # Various coordinate representations
        celestial: dict     # RA, Dec, Distance
        cartesian: dict     # X, Y, Z (light-years)
        mgrs: str           # 3D-MGRS reference (e.g., MMM-505050)
    
    # Astronomical attributes
    spectral_class: str     # E.g., "G2V"
    magnitude: dict         # Visual and absolute magnitudes
    
    # Game attributes
    faction: str            # Political affiliation
    notes: str              # Additional information
```

### 3D-MGRS Algorithm
The 3D Military Grid Reference System needs to efficiently:
1. Convert between celestial and Cartesian coordinates
2. Generate sector designations (XXX)
3. Calculate sub-grid references (NNNNNN)
4. Handle edge cases (e.g., negative coordinates)

### Mapping Algorithm Criteria
For fictional systems without real-world counterparts:
1. Match on spectral class (habitable planet preference)
2. Consider distance constraints from lore
3. Maintain political clustering
4. Check for astronomical plausibility
