# Documentation Directory

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the Stellar Cartography Project.

## Purpose

The documentation serves multiple purposes:
1. Explaining the project's concepts and design decisions
2. Providing implementation details and algorithms
3. Offering guidance on usage and development
4. Documenting the astronomical and fictional data integration approach

## Available Documentation

- **implementation_guide.md** - Detailed guide for implementing the project components
- **data_storage_plan.md** - Plan for storing and organizing star system data
- **prominent_stars.md** - Information about key star systems in the project
- **visualizations.md** - Documentation on visualization approaches and techniques
- **galactic_sectors.md** - Details about the galactic sector organization
- **galactic_grid_reference.md** - Explanation of the 3D-MGRS coordinate system
- **mapping_algorithm.md** - Documentation on algorithms for mapping fictional systems to real stars
- **csv_fields.md** - Reference for the fields in the star systems CSV files
- **fasa_systems_fields.md** - Reference for the fields in the FASA systems CSV file

## Documentation Format

All documentation is written in Markdown format for:
- Easy editing and maintenance
- Version control compatibility
- Conversion to other formats if needed
- Web-based rendering

## Updating Documentation

When updating the project's code or data, ensure that the relevant documentation is also updated. Documentation should be considered a first-class citizen in the development process.

## Recommended Reading Order

For new contributors, the recommended reading order is:
1. Project README.md (in the root directory)
2. galactic_grid_reference.md
3. data_storage_plan.md
4. csv_fields.md and fasa_systems_fields.md
5. mapping_algorithm.md
6. implementation_guide.md

## Adding New Documentation

When adding new documentation:
1. Use clear, descriptive filenames
2. Include a header with the document's purpose
3. Use proper Markdown formatting with headings, lists, and code blocks
4. Add cross-references to related documentation
5. Update this README with information about the new document
